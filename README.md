### Overview

Built a pipeline involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can be used to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of itâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
